Hello this is the file of instructions
# adding the components :
 - instead of adding just the file, add the folder and inside it add file called index.js and give the functional component the name you want ( don't forget the capital case because it is like class )
 - after that export it in index.js that exist in components folder to call them from all the app
 - before that we will install the dependencies like sass and mui and redux....
